🚀 Simulated Scalable Network Infrastructure Design
🏢 Multi-Branch Educational Institution | 🧠 Cisco Packet Tracer Simulation
📘 Overview
This project was developed as part of the EC4060 – Computer and Data Networks module during my 4th semester at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Jaffna. The simulation demonstrates the design of a scalable, segmented, and secure network infrastructure for a fictional institution comprising six branches: five academic departments and one administrative unit.

🎯 Objective
To apply foundational concepts in network architecture, IP subnetting, VLAN configuration, and inter-network routing to build a simulation that ensures:

Efficient communication 📡

Logical segmentation 🧩

Future scalability 📈

High-level security 🔐

🌟 Key Features
✅ Unique Subnet Allocation for each section ensuring optimized performance and data isolation
✅ Detailed Subnet Calculations including mask, range, and broadcast addresses
✅ 30% Scalability Consideration in every department for future expansion
✅ Role-Based Device Segmentation (Staff vs. Students)
✅ Logical VLAN Implementation for improved traffic management
✅ Topology Design with routers, switches, and realistic device allocation
✅ Centralized CCTV Subnet integrated across departments
