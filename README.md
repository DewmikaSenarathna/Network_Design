## 💻 **Strategic Networking — Designed with Purpose, Simulated with Precision**  
I’m thrilled to introduce my latest technical showcase:  
**“Simulated Scalable Network Infrastructure Design”** — a fully mapped and configured **network simulation** created using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. Developed as part of the **EC4060 – Computer and Data Networks** module during my 4th semester at the *Faculty of Engineering, University of Jaffna*, this project demonstrates how real-world networking principles can be applied to solve complex, multi-site infrastructure challenges.

This end-to-end simulation reflects a **large-scale educational institution** comprising six separate branches — each with its own **dedicated subnet, VLANs, and device architecture** — built with future scalability and secure communication in mind.

## 🌍 **Project Overview**  
The goal of this simulation is to represent a **realistic, scalable, and secure network** infrastructure for an institution with:

- 📍 6 branches (5 academic + 1 administrative)
- 👨‍🏫 Segmentation between Staff and Students
- 📈 Future expansion built into design
- 🔄 Smooth data flow and connectivity between branches
- 🔒 Logical separation using VLANs
- ✅ Real-time testing using ping and traceroute tools

---

## 🎯 **Project Objectives**
- ✔️ Establish a robust, interconnected multi-branch network
- ✔️ Create **logical subnets and VLANs** based on user roles
